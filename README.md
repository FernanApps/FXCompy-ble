## Architecture

### Structure
This architecture allows for a clear separation of responsibilities, makes it easier to test and maintain code, and allows layers to be independent and can be modified or replaced without affecting other layers.

*This architecture is separated in modules*

**Modules**


- **Presentation** is responsible for the user interface and user interaction. Here are the UI components and presentation logic. <br>  <br>

  <br>


-  **Data**   is responsible for data access and persistence. Here the repositories defined in the domain layer are implemented and frameworks and libraries are used to interact with data sources. <br> <br>

- **Domain**  is the core of the architecture and contains the main business logic of the application. Here the application-specific use cases and business rules are defined. <br><br>
